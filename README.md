# Almost Forgot That This Is The Whole Point

A video project that explores the tension between authenticity and performance on social media.

Using footage inspired by influencers, it examines how intimate moments with nature are carefully staged and curated for the gaze of an online audience â€” transforming real experiences into consumable spectacles optimized for algorithmic visibility.

The work unfolds across two video installations, progressing from no intervention to full datamoshing and blob-tracking distortion, pulling viewers deeper into the logic of the algorithm.

Through layered editing and glitch aesthetics, the project exposes the artificial construction behind these scenes, questioning what authenticity means in a world where every moment is curated for performance.

It invites viewers to reflect on how digital culture reshapes our relationship to experience, presence, and connection.
